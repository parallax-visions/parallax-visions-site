  Parallax Visions

Here lies the code to power the Parallax Visions website. The site is built with Gatsby and hosted via Linode server. We will utilize Travis-CI for deploying code.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

2.  **Install Gatsby.**
    
    Won't get far without our tools installed. 

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Clone the repo.**

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:parallax-visions/parallax-visions-site.git
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    After you have a local copy of the source we can run the dev server.

    ```shell
    cd parallax-visions-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

    You'll find the directory structure intuitive and will become less so as we add to the site.
